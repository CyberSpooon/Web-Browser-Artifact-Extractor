# Web-Browser-Artifact-Extractor
Here’s a quick and dirty powershell script to extract web browser artifacts for later analysis. The tool gathers artifacts from Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. It’s designed to be used with live response in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. To view the collected artifacts, use the tools below:

	- DB Browser for SQLite - https://sqlitebrowser.org/
	- Nirsoft Web Browser Tools - https://www.nirsoft.net/web_browser_tools.html
  - Foxton Forensics Browser History Viewer - https://www.foxtonforensics.com/browser-history-viewer/

Note: Does not yet support MacOS, or Linux.
